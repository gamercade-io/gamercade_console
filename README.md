## Motivation

Gamercade aims to solve the "I'm a small team/solo developer and I want to make a multiplayer game" problem. In order to have a successful game, these small projects need to have multiple successes:

- Building a project which correctly handles the complexities of online multiplayer.
- Marketing to a big enough playerbase to shorten wait times.
- Setting up server hosting, and the associated costs to keep them running well after release.
- Making a game which is actually fun to play.

With Gamercade, the first 3 requirements are removed. This creates a more modern development environment which lets game developers do what they do best: Make exciting games!

## Project Goals

Every feature and function of Gamercade and its related tools are built with the goals of achieving the following:

- **Effortless Multiplayer** - The main priority is developing a top-notch multiplayer experience for both players and developers. This means providing an easy-to-use networking solution for developers, and also one which is robust and high performant.
- **Empower Creatives** - Gamercade is a platform for all kinds of people, of different backgrounds and experience levels. Programmers, designers, artists, and are all welcome. Gamercade should empower creators and allow them to always do their best work.
- **"Neo Retro" Game Development** - Project scoping is important. Retro consoles are cool, but also constrained and complex. Gamercade provides the balance between retro and modern development. Games are limited by content, but creativity is unlimited.

# For Developers

Follow these steps to get your first game project up and running. See the included resources for more information. Also consider making yourself comfortable with the [Api Reference](https://gamercade.io/docs/api-reference).

## Building, Bundling, and Running A Game

Building, bundling, and running games requires a few different steps, which all depend on eachother. Below are steps on how to accomplish this using the editor through the GUI. Alternatively, a more efficient way can be done via the `gccl` tool. See the `gamercade_cli` folder for more information about how to invoke and use `gccl`.

### Building A Game (in Rust) - How to build a .wasm file

A template example project is available at: [rust_template](https://github.com/gamercade-io/rust_template)

1. If you don't already have it, install the `wasm target` by running `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
1. Write your game logic following the spec mentioned.
1. Build the game as a `.wasm` library. This can be done with `cargo build --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
1. The file will be output in `./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/project_name.wasm`.

### Bundling A Game with the Editor - How to create a .gcrom file

1. With your game `.wasm` already built from the previous steps...
1. Run the editor. This can be done from source via `cargo run --bin editor`
1. On the File menu, click "Select game .wasm." Find and locate your previously exported `.wasm` file.
1. On the File menu, click "Export game" and export.
1. Save the `.gcrom` file in the location of your choice.

### Running a Game with the Console - How to run a .gcrom file

1. With a `.gcrom` available to play from the previous steps...
1. Run the console. This can be done from source via `cargo run --bin console`
1. The console will run with the Main Menu already opened. You can open and close it with the `Spacebar`.
1. Press the "Select Game" button to open the file dialog.
1. Select the `.gcrom` file you wish to run, and click open.
1. Launch the game by pressing the "Launch Game" button.

### Running a Game as raw `.wasm`

If you are not using any custom assets, or are okay with the default color palettes, you can also run the raw `.wasm` files directly from the console. This can be done by following the steps outlined in "Building a Game" section above, or whatever workflow your programming language of choice requires for outputting a `.wasm` binary.
